## Demo Application
See [demo app](../games/demo-app) for a simple demonstrator of the capabilities of AnyPawn.

## Fundamentals

AnyPawns are a technology-augmented version of game pieces commonly found in most games. They are capable of capturing the set of [interaction events and produce digital feedbacks](../readme.md#design entities). The following tables cluster interaction events and digital feedback supported by typology and provide a player-perspective description of their role. Possible mapping with dynamics commonly found in board games are also exemplified. For example the action of shaking an anyPawn can be mapped to the draw of a random number or event.

Interaction events and digital feedbacks commands are exchanged between anyPawns and the smartphone running anyboardJS using a binary protocol using 1-3 byte. Mapping between events/feedbacks names and the binary codes is provided [here](./firmware/anypawn/protocol.h).

- The first byte describes the type of event or digital feedback (command)
- The second and third bytes add optional parameter

- Token-solo events use one byte only (name of the event)
- Token-constraint events use three bytes (name of the event, current sector ID, old sector ID)
- Token-token events use two bytes (name of the event, ID of the nearby pawn, side of the pawn) *NOT IMPLEMENTED*

### Interaction events

| Type | Interaction Event | Description | Sample mapping with game mechanics |
|------|-----------|-------------|------------------------------------|
| TE | SHAKE | anyPawn is shaken | Throw a random number |
| | TILT | anyPawn is tilted upside down | Undo a previous action |
| | TAP | anyPawn is tapped on the top side | Increase a resource by one unit |
|	| DOUBLE-TAP | anyPawn is double-tapped on the top side | Decrease a resource by one unit |
| TCE | ENTERS\_[cID] | anyPawn is moved inside a cID sector of the board | Signal player's placement and movements among different board sectors |
| | LEAVES\_[cID] | anyPawn is moved away from cID sector | Signal player's placement and movements among different board sectors  |
|	TTE | APCHES\_[aID2] | anyPawn is moved close to another one | Trade a resource between two players |
| | LEAVES\_[aID2] | anyPawn is moved away to another one | Break a relationship between two players |

TCEs recognition is implemented by assigning and imprinting unique colors to different sectors of a game board (representing visual constraints to tokenâ€™s locations). A color-sensor located on the bottom of anyPawn samples the color temperature of the surface the device is lying on, returning an unique color- code which is used as a fingerprint for board constraints, enabling to detect when anyPawn is moved between two sectors. TCE detection also makes use of accelerometer data to ensure that color sampling is performed only when the device is steady on a sector, deactivating the sensing routine when anyPawn being moved.
TTEs are recognized by computing the distance between two pawns using RSSI (Received Signal Strength) data from the radio transmitter.

### Digital feedbacks

| Type | Feedback | Description | Sample mapping with game mechanics |
|------|----------|-------------|------------------------------------|
| Visual | LED\_[color] | anyPawn lights up in the color defined by [color] | Show the status of a resource |
| | MATRIX\_[text] | anyPawn top side display shows the string [text] | Shows player's action point allowance |
| | MATRIX\_[icon] | anyPawn top side display shows the icon [icon]  | Show the result of a dice roll |
|Haptic| SHRT\_HAPTIC | anyPawn produces a short haptic feedback | Signal a player to move to the next turn |
|| LNG\_HATIC | anyPawn produces a long haptic feedback | Signal a player an action not allowed |

Token digital feedbacks are implemented using three different devices: an RGB LED, a 8x8 LED Matrix and a vibration motor.

## Case Construction

The appearance of anyPawn can be customized with handcrafted or 3D-printed models blending the digital feedback with a static iconic or symbolic shape.

The AnyPawn case showed in figure can be produced with 3D-printing or laser cutting techniques. Drawings are provided in the (case)[./case] directory.

## Hardware Schematics

A prototype of anyPawn can be built with the following off the shelf components. The anyPawn showed in figure is designed with custom hardware components and schematics and it's currently under testing.

## Firmware

### Setup
AnyPawn is based on RFDUINO hardware, which includes an Arduino core and Bluetooth LE transcriver. RFDUINO plugins need to be installed on the Arduino IDE following [this guide](https://github.com/RFduino/RFduino).

In order to use all the components listed in the hardware part, some Adafruit's and support libraries have been used. You can find these libraries in the *libraries* folder. Refer to the [manual installation section in the official Arduino library guide](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries#toc5) to install the libraries on your system.

Third parties libraries used (included in the libraries folder):

- For the ADXL345 the Adafruit_ADXL345 Arduino's library is used ([Adafruit_ADXL345](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_ADXL345)).
- The Adafruit_ADXL345 library is based on the Adafruit's Unified Sensor Library ([Adafruit_Sensor](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Sensor)).
- For the MPR121 the Adafruit_MPR121 Arduino's library is used ([Adafruit_MPR121](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_MPR121_Library))
- For the TCS34725 used with an autorage mechanism the Adafruit library is used ([Adafruit_TCS34725](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_TCS34725/tree/master/examples/tcs34725autorange))
- For the LED display the Adafruit_GFX library is used ([Adafruit_GFX](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library))
- And the Adafruit_lED_backpack library is also required ([Adafruit_lED_backpack](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-LED-Backpack-Library))
